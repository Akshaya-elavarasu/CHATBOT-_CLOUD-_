## DOMAIN NAME: CLOUD APPLICATION DEVELOPMENT 
## PROJECT NAME: CHATBOT DEPLOYMENT WITH IBM CLOUD WATSON   ASSISTANT

## Problem Definition:
This project involves the method on how to deploy a chatbot to production that is reliable, scalable, and secure.This problem definition encompasses all of the challenges mentioned in the previous note, such as chatbot design, training, testing, integration, and scalability.
To address this problem, it is important to use a chatbot development platform like IBM Cloud Watson Assistant and to carefully design, train, and test the chatbot before deploying it to production. It is also important to monitor the chatbot's performance after deployment and make adjustments as needed.

## Design Thinking: 
The design thinking process can be applied to Cloud application development projects to ensure that the solutions developed are user-centered and meet the needs of the target users.
### 1.Name: The chatbot name is given relevant to the  brand and the purpose of the chatbot. For example,"Customer Support Chatbot" or "Support Buddy."
Tone: The chatbot's tone is to be consistent with the brand voice. For example, if your brand is friendly and approachable, the chatbot's tone is also friendly and approachable.
Style of communication: The chatbot's style of communication is conversational and easy to understand.

Checking the status of an order, Requesting a refund, Getting help with a technical issue, Finding product information, Learning about shipping and return policies
### 3. Conversation Flow: Designing the conversation flow,4T outlining how the chatbot responds to user queries and prompts. It is important to design a conversation flow that is natural and easy to follow.

Using clear and concise language, Providing the user with all of the information they need to resolve their issue or complete their task, Offering the user multiple options to choose from, when appropriate, Providing the user with a way to escalate to a human agent if they need further assistance.
### 5.Platform Integration: The chatbot can also be integrated with popular messaging platforms like Facebook Messenger and Slack. This will allow users to interact with the chatbot on the platforms that they are already using.
### 6.User Experience: It is important to ensure a seamless and user-friendly experience, with clear prompts and informative responses.

## RESULT :
By following these steps, we can develop and deploy a chatbot that is reliable, scalable, secure, and provides a great user experience.
